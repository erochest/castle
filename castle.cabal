name:                castle
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            A tool to manage shared cabal-install sandboxes.
description:
  I really like having sandboxes baked into cabal-install.
  .
  However, I got tired of waiting for big packages like Yesod and Lens to
  compile in project after project that used them. However, I still didn't want
  to install them in the user database. I wanted to maintain /some/ sandboxing
  among a group of projects that all share a common set of packages, but I wanted
  to be able to switch from them or upgrade them easily.
  .
  That's the itch I was trying to scratch with `castle`.
  .
  It allows you to share one Cabal sandbox between multiple projects. This keeps
  the package versions for all of these projects in line. It also means that you
  don't have to constantly be re-installing everything, but you still get the
  ability to blow away a set of packages without borking your whole system.
